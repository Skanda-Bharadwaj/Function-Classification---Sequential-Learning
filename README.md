Understanding Sequential Extreme Learning Machines

This is a simple example to understand the way sequential extreme learning works. What we do here is to create our own functions that belong to three different classes. First kind of functions are sinusoids, second kind are exponential and the third belongs to polynomials. Now if you see the code, you can understand that the signals appear sequentially to the network in chunks, which the network learns. This is what is called sequetial learning.
